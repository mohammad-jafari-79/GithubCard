## gitHub User Profile Vue Component

I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to Daniel Kelly for providing such an insightful learning experience through the Vue Component Fundamentals with the Composition API course on VueSchool. I recently joined the course and found it to be incredibly valuable in deepening my understanding of Vue.js, especially the Composition API. As part of my training, I created a project based on his GitHub User Profile Vue Component video tutorial. I'm excited to share that I've uploaded the project repository as part of my learning journey. It was an excellent way to apply the concepts I learned and practice building Vue components in a real-world context. Thanks again, Daniel, for such a well-structured and engaging course!
